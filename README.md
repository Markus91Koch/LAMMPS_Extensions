# LAMMPS_Extensions
This is a collection of the extensions (fixes, computes, potentials) I've created for the MD simulation software package [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps/) [1,2].

## How to install

Simply copy the matching header (.h) and implementation files (.cpp) that you wish to use into the 'src/' folder of your LAMMPS installation and compile LAMMPS using the make option of your choice.
You can then invoke them in your LAMMPS scripts according to the usual naming conventions. The header files list the name inside the LAMMPS scripts as the first parameter of 'PairStyle(...)', 'ComputeStyle(...)' or 'FixStyle(...)', respectively.

## Class II Soft Potentials

- pair_style lj/class2/nosoft/coul/cut/soft
- pair_style lj/class2/soft/coul/cut/nosoft
- pair_style lj/class2/soft/
- pair_style lj/class2/soft/deriv
- pair_style coul/cut/soft/deriv

This contains a series of soft 9--6 Lennard--Jones and Coulomb pair potentials [3] that are compatible with Class II force fields (PCFF, COMPASS, ...) and which can be used to perform thermodynamic integration (TI) with less instabilities and improved sampling of the full phase space. 
I've originally adapted these from the soft potentials of the [USER-FEP](https://github.com/agiliopadua/compute_fep) package (developed by [Agilio Padua](https://github.com/agiliopadua/)) but now for Class II force fields. 
By now, LAMMPS has added such Class II Soft Potentials to the official distribution, indepently from the code here. They use a similar or sometimes the same notation as here.
Here are also potentials provided, which output the derivatives with respect to the parameter $lambda$ (the coupling parameter of TI), which should only be used during a "rerun" of a trajectory in LAMMPS.

## Computes

- compute asphericity
- compute asphericity/chunk
- compute ellipsoid/chunk
- compute nematic/chunk

These computes calculate properties related to orientation, shape, and structure of atom groups (or chunk) in an MD simulation.
They can be used to determine the asphericity of a molecule, the principal axes and their directions, and the nematic order parameter of a collection of molecules.
In the current form, this code is mostly intended for atomistic simulations ('atom_style full') and is not tested to work with ellipsoidal particles (Gay-Berne etc.).

## Fixes

- fix chicken/chunk

Mainly, here the 'fix_chicken_chunk' is given, which (despite the silly name) is developed for atomistic simulations of azobenzene-containing materials under UV/Vis irradiation.
This fi xexerts an angle-dependent torque arising from an effective orientation potential according to the so-called orientation approach [4].

## To do

- Write documentation for the code
- Clean up the code and subit it to the LAMMPS project
